// There are two types of labels that can be added to Todoist tasks. We refer to
// these as personal and shared labels.
//
// # Personal labels
//
// Labels created by the current user will show up in their personal label list.
// These labels can be customized and will stay in their account unless deleted.
//
// A personal label can be converted to a shared label by the user if they no
// longer require them to be stored against their account, but they still appear
// on shared tasks.
//
// # Shared labels
//
// A label created by a collaborator that doesn't share a name with an existing
// personal label will appear in our clients as a shared label. These labels are
// gray by default and will only stay in the shared labels list if there are any
// active tasks with this label.
//
// A user can convert a shared label to a personal label at any time. The label
// will then become customizable and will remain in the account even if not
// assigned to any active tasks.
//
// Shared labels do not appear in the sync response for a user's account. They
// only appear within the labels list of the [Task] that they are assigned to.
//
// You can find more information on the differences between personal and shared
// labels in our [Help Center].
//
// See [Labels] for more details.
